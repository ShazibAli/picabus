= Websites links: =

1. http://busline.gov.il/ - request sent.

2. http://www.bus.gov.il/ - request sent.
   Contains data about bus lines in "Gush Dan" only.
   Looks really good and has all the maps of each line (can be great for 
   us).

3. http://www.bus.co.il/ - request not sent.

In conclusion to this issue:
As i see it there are a few options
1. Gain access to one of the above site's DB and build our own based on it.
2.Gain access to each bus line company DB and build DB based on it.
3. Write a script that will send queries to the sites above\bus line companies sites and build the DB that way.

i looked at the companies sites - we can get by query every info we need including stations(Metropolin has station numbers..other i'm not sure).
any way the thing is that each site will require a different script, therefore i believe we should try and use the sites above or get the DB directly. worst case we'll write the script.
